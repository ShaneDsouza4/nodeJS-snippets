*JSON REST API to make;
We want to make a Hybrid server, where mobile devs can also use.

- GET /users - HTML Document Render - Done
- GET /api/users - List all users - Done


- GET /api/users/1 - Get user with ID 1  /api/users/:id (Using Dynamic Path Parameter) - Done
- GET /api/users/2 - Get user with ID 2 - Done


- POST /api/users - Create new user
If do simple req.body will show undefined.
Use a middleware, so that form data can be put in the body.
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false})); //For www
app.use(express.json()); //For JSON

- PATCH /api/user/1 - Edit the user with ID 1
- DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the User with ID 1


https://www.mockaroo.com/ to generate fake data.
require the users JSON

Think of middleware like a plugin.
