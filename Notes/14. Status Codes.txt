> Best Practices

- Created: 201
res.status(201).json({status:"success", id: users.length});

- Don't send anything in return: 204

- Missing data in payload: 400
if(!body || !body.email){
        return res.status(400).json({msg:"Email is required"});
}


- Unauthorized: 401
Login to send request.

- Credit card exhausted: 402

- Forbidden with no permission: 403

- Not found: 404 
Page not found.
Should also be for no user found;
if(!user){
        return res.status(404).json({msg:"No user found!"});
}


- We are iterating on users and did a typo. so 500
